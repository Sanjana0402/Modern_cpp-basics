Class engine should have the following attributes
    -engine_id of type string
    -engine_type which could br HYBRID, ICE or ALTERNATE_FUEL
    -engine_cc which is a float value
    -engine_torque which is float
    -engine_horse_power which is an int value

Create the following functionalities
    1. Create 5 objects of the class Engine on the heap. Attach a shared_pointer to each object and emplace them into a list container
    2. A function to return a container of shared_pointer to obj which satisfy the predicate function passed
    3. A function to find and return if atleast one object meets the given predicate function
    4. A function to find the average of m_cc and return the value

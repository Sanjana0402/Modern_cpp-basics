CheckDivisibilityBy3  (bool) : int32_t --> The function should return true or false for checking if the number is divisible by 3 or not respectively

CheckNaturalNumber (bool) : int32_t --> The function should return true or false for checking if the number is a natural number or not . (Positive number more than 0)

CheckPrimeNumber (bool) : int32_t --> The function should return true or false for checking if the number is prime or not. (Positive number more than 0)

ComputeSquare (void) : int32_t --> The function should display the square value of the input number provided

ComputeFactorial (void) : unsigned int --> function should print the facttorial of a Positive numbers if the number is between 1 to 10. For a number above 10, throw an exception for invalid argument with a message "Number not valid".

FindNumbers (void) : std::vector<int32_t>, Predicate function --> 

    The function must 
            - filter the input Container of integers and display all numbers satisfying the Predicate passed

    Demonstrate
            -CheckDivisibilityBy3
            -CheckNaturalNumber
            -CheckPrimeNumber

            funtions by passing them to FilterNumbers function one by one


MapOperation (void) : std::vector<int32_t>, Mapping function -->

    function must 
            -Apply the Mapping function received a sinput and display output in screen

    Demonstrate
            - ComputeSquare
            - ComputeFactorial


            funtions by passing them to MapOperation function one by one
